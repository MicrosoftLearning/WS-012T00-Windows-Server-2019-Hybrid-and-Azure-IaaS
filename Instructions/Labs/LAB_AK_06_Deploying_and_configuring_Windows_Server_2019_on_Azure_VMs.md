# Lab answer key: Deploying and configuring Windows Server 2019 on Azure VMs

## Exercise 1: Authoring Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for Azure VM deployment

### Task 1: Enable the Standard tier of Security Center

In this task, you will enable the Standard tier of Azure Security Center.

>**Note**: Skip this task and proceed directly to the next one if you have already upgraded Security Center in your Azure subscription to the Standard tier.

1. From  **SEA-CL1**, start Microsoft Edge, and then navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). When prompted, sign in using a user account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box, on the toolbar, search for and select **Security Center**.
1. On the **Security Center \| Getting started** blade, select **Upgrade** and then, select **Install agents**.

### Task 2: Generate an ARM template and parameters files by using the Azure portal

In this task, you will use the Azure portal to create resource groups and create a disk in the resource group.

1. From  **SEA-CL1**, start Microsoft Edge, and then navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). When prompted, sign in using a user account with the Owner or the Contributor role, in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box, on the toolbar, search for and select **Virtual machines**. In the **Virtual machines** blade, select **+ Add** and then select **Virtual machine**.
1. In the **Create a virtual machine** blade, on the **Basics** tab, specify the following settings and leave all other settings with their default values, but do not deploy it:

   *Table 1: Azure VM Basics settings*

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Subscription|Use the name of the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.|
   |Resource group|ws2019-06-rg1|

1. Select **Next: Advanced >**, on the **Advanced** tab of the **Create a virtual machine** blade, review the available settings without modifying any of them, and then select **Review + Create**.

    >**Note**: Do not create the virtual machine. You will use for this purpose the autogenerated template.

### Task 3: Download the ARM template and parameters files from the Azure portal

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Create a virtual machine** blade, select **Download a template for automation**.
1. On the **Template** blade, select **Download**.
1. Select the ellipsis button next to the **template.zip** and, in the pop-up menu, select **Show in folder**. This will automatically open File Explorer displaying the content of the **Downloads** folder.

### Task 2: Add an Azure VM extension section to the existing template

1. On **SEA-CL1**, in the Notepad window displaying the content of the **template.json** file, insert the following code directly after the `    "resources": [` line):

   ```json
        {
           "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
           "name": "[concat(parameters('virtualMachineName'), '/customScriptExtension')]",
           "apiVersion": "2018-06-01",
           "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
           "dependsOn": [
               "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', parameters('virtualMachineName'))]"
           ],
           "properties": {

              }
           }
        },
   ```

1. Save the change and close the file.

## Exercise 3: Deploying Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019 by using ARM templates

### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an ARM template

1. On **SEA-CL1**, switch to the browser window displaying the Azure portal.
1. In the Azure portal, on the toolbar, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box, search for and select **Template deployment (deploy using custom templates)**.
1. In the **Custom deployment** blade, select **Build your own template in the editor**.
1. In the **Edit template** blade, select **Load file**, upload the template file **template.json** that you edited in the previous exercise, and then select **Save**.
1. In the **Custom deployment** blade, select **Edit parameters**.
1. In the **Edit parameters** blade, select **Load file**, upload the parameters file **parameters.json** that you reviewed in the previous exercise, and then select **Save**.

   |Admin Password|Pa55w.rd1234|

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**.
1. Verify that the deployment completed successfully.

    >**Note**: The deployment might take about 10 minutes.

### Task 2: Review results of the Azure VM deployment

1. In the Azure portal, on the toolbar, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box, search for and select **Resource groups**.
1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **ws2019-06-rg1** entry.
1. On the **ws2019-06-rg1** blade, on the **Overview** blade, review the list of resources, including the Azure VM **ws2019-06-vm0**.
1. Within the list of resources, select the Azure VM **ws2019-06-vm0** entry. 1. On the **ws2019-06-vm0** blade, select **Extensions**, and on the list of extensions, verify that the **customScriptExtension** has been provisioned successfully.
1. Navigate back to the **ws2019-06-rg1** blade, and in the **Settings** section, select **Deployments**.
1. On the **ws2019-06-rg1|Deployments** blade, select the **Microsoft.Template** link.
1. On the **Microsoft.Template|Overview** blade, select **Template**, and note that this is the same template you used for deployment.

## Exercise 4: Configuring administrative access to Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019

1. Navigate back to the **Security Center|Coverage** blade, and then in the **ADVANCED CLOUD DEFENSE** section, select **Just in time VM access**.
1. On the **Security Center|Just in time VM access** blade, select the **Unsupported** tab, and note the entry representing the **ws2019-06-vm0** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: This is expected because the Azure VM is currently not accessible from internet and doesn't have an NSG associated with its network interface.
    
    >**Note**: It might take about 10 minutes for the VM to appear in the Unsupported tab. You may continue with the next exercise.

## Exercise 5: Configuring Windows Server 2019 security in Azure VMs

### Task 1: Create and configure an NSG

1. In the Azure portal, on the toolbar, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box, search for and select **Network security groups**.

## Exercise 6: Deprovisioning the Azure environment

### Task 1: Start a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell

1. Back in the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** blade  by selecting the Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, and then select **PowerShell**.

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you're starting **Cloud Shell** and you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

### Task 2: Identify all Azure resources provisioned in the lab

1. From the Cloud Shell blade, run the following command to list all resource groups created throughout this lab:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ws2019-06-*'
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell blade, run the following command to delete all resource groups created throughout this lab:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ws2019-06-*'|Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *-AsJob* parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately after within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
