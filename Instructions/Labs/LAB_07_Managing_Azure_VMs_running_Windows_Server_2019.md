# Lab: Managing Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019

## Lab scenario

To address concerns regarding the outdated operational model and Information Security concerns regarding additional controls that should be applied to Azure VMs running Windows Server-based workloads, you will test a new approach to management tasks that target Windows Server 2019 running in Azure VMs.

Rather than relying on Remote Desktop sessions—which are currently used for management of the on-premises computers running the Windows OS—for this purpose you will use a range of other tools at your disposal that streamline the running of management tasks.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Provision Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019.
- Manage Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019 by using Windows Admin Center.
- Manage Windows Server 2019 running in Azure VMs by using PowerShell Remoting.
- Manage Windows Server 2019 running in Azure VMs by using Run Command.
- Manage Windows Server 2019 in Azure VMs by using the serial console.
- Manage Windows Server 2019 in Azure VMs by using Azure Policy Guest Configuration.
- Deprovision the Azure lab environment.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Lab setup

You'll need **WS-012T00A-SEA-DC1** and **WS-012T00A-SEA-CL1** to complete this lab.

Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** by using **Pa55w.rd** as the password.

You will browse to the Azure portal from **SEA-CL1** and then use Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019 installed by using Azure PowerShell. 

## Exercise 1: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019

   ```

   > **Note**: Wait for the compliance scan to complete. For more information regarding time it takes to complete different types of Azure Policy processing, refer to [Evaluation triggers](https://aka.ms/evaluation-triggers) and [Validation frequency](https://aka.ms/guest-configuration-validation-frequency). 

   > **Note**: Since you installed Web Server (IIS) server role on **Mod07Target**, that VM should be listed as compliant. However, since the resource group **ws2019-07-rg1** also contains the **Mod07Gateway** VM which does not include the Web Server (IIS) server role, the state of that resource and the assignment should be listed as **Non-compliant**.

1. To verify compliance status of individual resources, on **SEA-CL1**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to the **Mod07Target** blade.

1. From the **Mod07Target** blade, navigate to its **Policies** blade. 

1. Verify that the **Audit Windows VMs on which the specified services are not installed and 'Running'** policy is listed as **Compliant**.

1. To verify compliance status of individual resources, on **SEA-CL1**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to the **Mod07Gateway** blade.

1. From the **Mod07Gateway** blade, navigate to its **Policies** blade. 

1. Verify that the **Audit Windows VMs on which the specified services are not installed and 'Running'** policy is listed as **Non-compliant**.
