# Lab: Implementing integration between AD DS and Azure AD

## Scenario

To address concerns regarding management and monitoring overhead resulting from using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to authenticate and authorize access to Azure resources, you decide to test integration between on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Azure AD to verify that this will address business concerns about managing multiple user accounts by using a mix of on-premises and cloud resources.

Additionally, you want to make sure that your approach addresses the Information Security team's concerns and preserves existing controls applied to Active Directory users, such as sign-in hours and password policies. Finally, you want to identify Azure AD integration features that allow you to further enhance on-premises Active Directory security and minimize its management overhead, including Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory and Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) with password writeback.

Your goal is to implement pass-through authentication between on-premises AD DS and Azure AD.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Prepare Azure AD for integration with on-premises AD DS, including adding and verifying a custom domain.
- Prepare on-premises AD DS for integration with Azure AD, including running IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool, and configuring user principal name (UPN) suffixes.
- Install and configure Azure AD Connect.
- Verify integration between AD DS and Azure AD by testing the synchronization process.
- Implementing Azure AD integration features in Active Directory, including Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory and SSPR with password writeback.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Lab setup

Virtual machines: **SEA-DC1** and **SEA-SVR2** virtual machines (VMs) must be running. Other VMs can be running, but they aren't required for this lab.

You should sign in to **SEA-SVR2** as **Contoso\Administrator** by using the following credentials:

- Username: **CONTOSO\\Administrator**
- Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you'll use the available VM environment and an Azure subscription. Before you begin the lab, ensure that you have an Azure subscription and a user account with an Owner or Contributor role in your subscription.

## Exercise 1: Preparing Azure AD for AD DS integration

### Scenario

You need to ensure that your Azure AD environment is ready for integration with your on-premises AD DS. Therefore, you'll create and verify a custom Azure AD domain name and an account with the Global Administrator role.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Create a custom domain name in Azure.
1. Create a user with the Global Administrator role.
1. Reset the password for the user with the Global Administrator role.

### Task 1: Create a custom domain name in Azure

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, start Microsoft Edge, and then browse to the Azure portal.

1. Use the credentials that you instructor provides to sign in to the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to **Azure Active Directory**.

1. On the **Azure Active Directory** page, select **Custom domain names**, and then add ```contoso.com```.

1. Review the DNS record types that you would use to verify the domain.

>**Note:** The domain name provided might not be a valid domain. While you would use DNS records to verify a domain, this lab doesn't require that verification step.

### Task 2: Create a user with the Global Administrator role

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, on the **Azure Active Directory** page in the Azure portal, select **Users**.

1. On the **All Users** page, select **New User**.

1. On the **New User** page, for the **User name** and **Name** text boxes under **Identity**, enter **admin**.

>**Note:** Ensure the domain name drop-down menu for the **User name** lists the default domain name ending with ```onmicrosoft.com```. Also, make note of the password as you'll use it later.

1. Under **Groups and roles**, next to **Roles**, select **User**.
2. In the **Directory roles** page, in the list of roles, select **Global administrator**, and then select **Select**.
3. On the **New user** page, select **Create**.

### Task 3: Reset the password for the user with the Global Administrator role

1. On the **Azure portal** page, select your user account and then select **Sign out**.

1. On the **Pick an account** page, select **Use another account**.

1. On the **Sign in** page, enter the fully-qualified username of the user account you previously created, and then select **Next**.

1. For the current password, use the password that you wrote down in the previous step.

1. Enter **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd** as the new password, and then select **Sign in**.

>**Note:** The Azure portal might not allow using a shorter password when updating.

## Exercise 2: Preparing on-premises AD DS for Azure AD integration

### Scenario

You need to ensure that your existing Active Directory environment is ready for Azure AD integration. Therefore, you'll run the IdFix tool, and then ensure that the UPNs of the Active Directory users match the Azure AD tenant's custom domain name.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Install IdFix.

1. Run IdFix.

### Task 1: Install IdFix

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, open Microsoft Edge, and then browse to **https://github.com/microsoft/idfix**.

1. On the **Github** page, under **ClickOnce Launch**, select **launch**.

1. In the **IdFix Privacy Statement** dialog box, review the disclaimer, and then select **OK**.

### Task 2: Run IdFix

1. In the **IdFix** window, select **Query**.
1. Review the list of objects from the on-premises Active Directory, and observe the **ERROR** and **ATTRIBUTE** columns. In this scenario, the value of **displayName** for **ContosoAdmin** is blank, and the tool's recommended new value appears in the attribute column.
1. In the **IdFix** window, in the **ACTION** drop-down menu, select **Edit**, and then select **Apply** to automatically implement the recommended changes.

1. In the **Apply Pending** dialog box, select **Yes**, and then close the IdFix tool.

## Exercise 3: Downloading, installing, and configuring Azure AD Connect

### Scenario

Exercise scenario: You're now ready to implement the integration by downloading Azure AD Connect, installing it on **SEA-SVR2**, and configuring its settings to match the integration objective.

The main task for this exercise is:

- Install and configure Azure AD Connect.

### Task 1: Install and configure Azure AD Connect

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, open Microsoft Edge, browse to the Microsoft website, and search for “Install Azure AD Connect” to find the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** page.

1. On the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** page, select **Download**.

1. On the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** page, select the **I agree to the license terms and privacy notice** check box, and then select **Continue**.

1. On the **Express Settings** page, select **Use express settings**.

1. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, enter the username and password of the Global Administrator account you created in exercise 1, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Connect to AD DS** page, enter the following credentials, and then select **Next**:

- Username: **CONTOSO\\Administrator**
- Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1. On the **Azure AD sign-in configuration** page, verify that the new domain you added is in the list of Active Directory UPN Suffixes.

>**Note:** The domain name provided might not be a verified domain. While you typically must verify a domain prior to installing Azure AD Connect, this lab doesn't require that verification step.

1. Select the **Continue without matching all UPN suffixes to verified domains** check box, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Ready to configure** page, review the list of actions, and then select **Install**.

## Exercise 4: Verifying integration between AD DS and Azure AD
