# Lab: Using Azure Security Center in hybrid scenarios

## Exercise 1: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019

### Task 1: Start Azure Cloud Shell

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Open Microsoft Edge, and then browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Sign in by using the credentials that you created for this course.
1. On the Azure portal, select **Cloud Shell**.
1. Select **PowerShell**.
1. When prompted, verify that your subscription is chosen, and then select **Create storage**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure VM by using Azure Resource Manager templates

**Upload the Resource Manager templates**

1. In Cloud Shell, select **Upload/Download files**, and then select **Upload**.
1. Browse to the Desktop folder and then the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Mod04** folder.
1. Select the **M04-lab-rg_template.json** file, and then select **Open**.
1. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the following files:
    - **M04-lab-rg_template.parameters.json**
    - **M04-lab-sub_template.json**

**Create a resource group**

1. In Cloud Shell, enter the following command, replacing *\<region>* with an Azure region that's close to you:

    ```powershell
    New-AzSubscriptionDeployment -Location '<region>' -Name ws2019-m04deployment -TemplateFile ./M04-lab-sub_template.json -rgLocation '<region>' -rgName 'm04-rg'
    ```

**Create a Windows Server virtual machine (VM)**

1. In Cloud Shell, enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name windows-m04rgDeployment -ResourceGroupName m04-rg -TemplateFile ./M04-lab-rg_template.json -TemplateParameterFile ./M04-lab-rg_template.parameters.json
    ```

1. Close Cloud Shell.
1. Wait for deployment to complete.

> **Note:** You can close Cloud Shell before deployment is complete.

## Exercise 2: Configuring Azure Security Center

### Task 1: Make Security Center available and upgrade to the Standard pricing tier

1. In the search box, enter `Security Center`, and then select **Security Center** from the results.
1. On the **Security Center** menu, select **Getting started**.
1. On the **Upgrade** tab of the **Getting started** pane, for **Enable standard tier on 1 subscriptions**, select your subscription.
1. Select **Upgrade**.

    > **Note:** Your subscription may already be upgraded for Security Center in which case there will not be an upgrade button and you may continue with Task 2.

1. Select **Continue without installing agents**.

### Task 2: Turn on automatic provisioning of the Log Analytics agent

1. Browse back to Security Center.
1. In Security Center, select **Pricing & settings**, select your subscription, and then select **Auto Provisioning**.

1. In the **Workspace configuration** section, verify that **ASC default workspace** is selected, and then select **Save** if it is not already enabled.
1. Refresh the page, and then browse back to the **Auto Provisioning** page.
1. Verify that **Log Analytics agent for Azure VMs** is **On** and the **Description** indicates that security related configurations and events will be collected. Select **Edit Configuration** and verify **All Events** is selected. If not, select it and save the setting.

> **Note:** It might take up to 30 minutes for the **Log Analytics** workspace to be created after selecting **Save** in step 4. You might need to refresh the page several times before the option to select **All Events** is available. Continue only after you're able to select **All events** and save the setting.

### Task 3: Review the features and capabilities that apply to hybrid scenarios

1. In the **General** section of Security Center, select **Inventory**.
1. Review the **Recommendation** list.

   > **Note:** The **Failed Resources** box indicates the type of resource to which the recommendation applies and lists how many resources the recommendation applies to.
