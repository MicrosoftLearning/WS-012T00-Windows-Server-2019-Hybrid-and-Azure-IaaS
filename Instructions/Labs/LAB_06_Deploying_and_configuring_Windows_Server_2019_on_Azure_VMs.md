# Lab: Deploying and configuring Windows Server 2019 on Azure VMs

## Scenario

You need to address concerns regarding your current infrastructure. You have an outdated operational model, a limited use of automation, and Information Security team concerns regarding additional controls that should be applied to Azure VMs running Windows Server-based workloads. You have decided to develop and implement an automated deployment and configuration process for Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019.

The process will involve Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and OS configuration through Azure VM extensions. It will also incorporate additional security protection mechanisms beyond those already applied to on-premises systems, such as application whitelisting through AppLocker, file integrity checks, and adaptive network/DDoS protection. You will also leverage JIT functionality to restrict administrative access to Azure VMs to public IP address ranges associated with the London headquarters.

Your goal is to deploy and configure Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019 in the manner that satisfies manageability and security requirements.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Author ARM templates for an Azure VM deployment.
- Modify ARM templates to include VM extension-based configuration.
- Deploy Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019 by using ARM templates.
- Configure administrative access to Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019.
- Configure Windows Server 2019 security in Azure VMs.
- Deprovision the Azure environment.
