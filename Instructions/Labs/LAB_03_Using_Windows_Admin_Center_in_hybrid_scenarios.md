1. In the Azure portal, open a PowerShell session in the **Cloud Shell** blade.
1. Upload the file **M03-lab-sub_template.json** , which can be found at C:\Labfiles\Mod03 into the Cloud Shell home directory.
1. From the Cloud Shell blade, run the following to create a resource group that will contain resources you provision in this lab (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the location of your lab computer):

   ```pwsh
   $location = '<Azure region>'
   New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
     -Location $location `
     -Name ws2019-m031subDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/M03-lab-sub_template.json `
     -rgLocation $location `
     -rgName 'ws2019-m031-rg'
   ```

    >**Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [Find Azure credit offers in your region](https://aka.ms/regions-offers).

### Task 2: Create an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the Cloud Shell blade, upload an Azure Resource Manager template **M03-lab-rg_template.json** and a parameter file **M03-lab-rg_template.parameters.json**.

1. From the Cloud Shell blade, run the following to deploy a Azure VM running Windows Server 2019 that you'll be using in this lab:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -Name ws2019-m031rgDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName 'ws2019-m031-rg' `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/M03-lab-rg_template.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/M03-lab-rg_template.parameters.json
